# Simple 8Ball Discord Bot
Using the Discord.py, I made a simple basic 8Ball bot that replies with premade sentences.

# **Setting up the scene**

**First:**  
You need to do is install discord.py on your machine, which you can do following the steps in this [page](https://pypi.org/project/discord.py/)

**Second:**  
Create a bot account to work with the library and the Discord API by following these steps:
1. Log on to [Discord](https://discord.com/).
2. Go to the [developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/) and make a new application by clicking on the button in the top right corner.
3. Create a Bot User by going over to the "Bot" tab and clicking "Add Bot". (You can make the bot public if you want others to invite it or private where only you can invite it.)
4. Copy the bot's token and save it. (Never share the token with anyone else.)

**Third:**  
Invite your bot by following these steps:
1. Go to the "OAuth2" tab on your bot's page.
2. Tick the checkbox that says "Bot" under "Scopes".
3. Tick the following checkboxes under "Bot Permissions": "Send Messages", "Manage Messages", and "Read Message History".
4. After that you will be given a URL that is used to add your bot to a server, just copy and paste that URL into your browser and choose a server to invite the bot to.

# **Getting the bot online**
All you need to do now is put the bot's token you saved earlier in the code where it's specified and run the code!
